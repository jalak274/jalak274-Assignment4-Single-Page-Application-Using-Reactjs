**Assignment 4: My First Single Page Application Using ReactJS!**

I have created a single page website using ReactJS that consists of 4 sections Header, Main, Nav and Footer. In which main section contains 3 Blog Posts. And Nav displays Google news headlines fetched from Google News API by AJAX call.

**How to run application.**

Step 1: Get the clone of repository and open it in VS CODE.<br />
Step 2: Run command - npm install<br />
Step 3: Run command - npm start<br />

We can try different API links through this link using different live examples by entering on line 25 of nav.js
https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything

And then it will redirect to the browser, where the webpage will be displayed.
